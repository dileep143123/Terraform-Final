Important Pointers for Exam part3:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Terraform Functions:
====================
The terraform language includes a number of built-in functions that you can use to transform and combine values.

> max(5, 12, 9)
12

The terraform language does not support user-defined functions, and so only the functions built into the language are available for use.

Be aware of basic functions like element, lookup

Count and Count Index:
======================
The count parameter on resources can simplify configurations and let you scale resources by simply incrementing a number.

In resource block where count is set, an additional count object(count.index) is available in expressions, so that you can modify the configuration of each instance.

resource "aws_iam_user" "lb" {
	name = "loadbalancer.${count.index}"
	count = 5
	path = "/system/"
} 

Find the issue - Use-Case:
=========================
You can expect use-case with the terraform code, and you have to find what should be removed as part of Terraform best practice.

terraform {
	backend "s3" {
	  bucket = "mybucket"
	  key = "path/to/my/key"
	  region = "us-east-1"
	  access_key = 123
	  secret_key = 123456
	}
}

Terraform Lock:
===============
If supported by your backend, terraform will lock your state for all operations that could write state.


Terraform has a force-unlock command to manually unlock the state if unlocking failed.

Usecase - Resources deleted out of Terraform:
=============================================
You have created an ec2 instance. Someone has modified the ec2 instance manually. What will happen if you will do terraform plan yet again ?

1. Someone has changed ec2 instance type from t2.micro to t2.large ? (terraform apply)
2. Someone has terminated the ec2 instance. (terraform apply)

Answer1) Terraform's current state will have t2.large, and the desired state is t2.micro. It will try to change back instance type to t2.micro.

Answer2) Terraform will create new ec2 instance. 

Resource Block:
===============
Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.

A resource block declares a resource of a given type("aws_instance") with a given local name("web")

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
	ami = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
} 

Sentinel:
========
Sentinel is a embedded policy-as-code framework integrated with the HashiCorp Enterprise products.

Can be used for various use-cases like:
1. Verify if ec2 instance has tags.
2. Verify if s3 bucket has encryption enabled.

terraform plan ----> snntinal checks ----> terraform apply

Sensitive Data in State file:
=============================
If you manage any sensitive data with terraform (like database passwords, user passwords or private keys), treat the state itself as sensitive data.

Approaches in such scenaros:

Terrafom cloud always encrypts the state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit. Terraform cloud also knows the identity of the user requesting state and maintains  a history of state changes.

The S3 backend supports encryption at rest when the encrypt option is enabled.

Dealing Configurations in Config:
================================
Hard-Coding credentials into any terraform configuration are not recommended, and risks the secret leakage should this file ever be committed to public version control system.

You can store the credentials outside of terraform configuration.

Storing credentials as part of environment variables is also a much better approach then hard coding it in the system.

Remote Backend for Terraform Cloud:
===================================
The remote backed stores terraform state and may be used to run operations in terraform cloud.

When using full remote operations, operations like terraform plan or terrafom apply can be executed in terraform's cloud run environment, with log output streaming to the local terminal.

Miscellaneous Pointers:
=======================
Terraform does not require go as a prerequisite.

It works well in windows, linux and Mac

Windows server is not mandatory.
